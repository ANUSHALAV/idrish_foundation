                    <h2 class="mb-4">IMPACT OF EVENING CLASS</h2>
                    <p class="text-justify">Before I attempt to narrate the story of this brilliant and diligent girl, I
                        can’t help but
                        reflect on the things that we take for granted.
                        From having the opportunity to go to school, on top of that being able to attend tuitions and
                        due to God’s grace have teachers, we do take them for granted at some point in our school life,
                        don’t we?
                        Muskan is a girl who belongs to Bihar. Due to a weak financial background, she came all the way
                        to Ambala, Haryana to study in a government school.
                        Nothing extinguished the fire which ignited within her to impart light through education.
                        To her disappointment, her school did not have teachers for mathematics and science.
                        Most of us can remember those science and mathematics classes that sounded French in school, we
                        really do need teachers for these subjects.
                        Muskan didn’t lose hope, she had a will to learn and paved a way for herself.
                        Muskan joined our foundation and we had the privilege to refine such a gem. She had been our
                        student since 2019 when we started our Project Evening Class.
                        Our Foundation used to conduct classes only on the weekends in those days. Our volunteer
                        teachers did everything they could to help her. She was regular to the classes and made diligent
                        efforts.
                        Her dedication and hard work were inspiring. For such children we aspire to grow more and more
                        as a non-profit organization.
                        Thus with the dedication of our volunteers and through a collective measure with your support we
                        can reach as many children as we can, who are in need of support.
                        Muskan’s determination, hard work, dedication and our support helped her to break through all
                        the barriers in her way.
                        With pride we have the occasion to inform you that in May 2023 she scored 92% in 10th boards in
                        HBSE.

                        Passing with flying colors is not her only accomplishment to be proud of.

                        She participated in the Super Hundred exam conducted by the government of Haryana in three
                        stages. They pick hundred students from Haryana for whom they sponsor further education.

                        Muskan acquired 8th position all over Haryana in this exam and she is now in Rohtak for further
                        studies. It is such an occasion to swell with pride and also be aware and kind.

                        Kavita (85%), Manpriti (82%), Karishma (80%) and many such students of our foundation also
                        performed really well.
                        This impact which her story reflects is an awakening call for all those who can come forward,
                        volunteer, contribute, and donate to offer support to so many Muskan’s out there.
                        We made an impact and she is a living example, we can also make a change, educate every such
                        student through a collective measure by joining our hands together.
